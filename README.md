# The Cryptic Impacts of Invasion: Functional Homogenization of Tropical Ant Communities by Invasive Fire Ants
Hello everyone!\
This repository aims to reproduce some data published in: https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.06870 .\
Data can be found here: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.s7h44j13f .\
*DATA IS NOT MINE*\
 \
There are 4 files in this repository:\
[1] BIOL8121stASSIGNMENT.Rmd is a R-Markdown that goes through some of the background analysis that was done in the paper, but not shown.\
Within this RMD:\
1) A Principal Component Analsysis (PCA) was conducted to observe the variation of 6 traits in 29 different fire ant species.\
2) A Trait Probability Density (TPD) approach was conducted at the species level to observe trait similarities and differences between species.\

TPD Analysis at the species level was supposed to turn into the community level, then into Functional richness (FRic), Functional evenness (FEve), Functional divergence (FDiv)


matrix.freq 1.csv is comma-separated values file that was not used in this analysis \
traits.ind 1.csv is comma-separated values file that was used in order to do the PCA \
